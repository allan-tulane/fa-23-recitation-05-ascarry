- **e.**
Suppose that we used Huffman coding on a document with alphabet $\Sigma$ in which every character had the same frequency. What is the expected cost of a Huffman encoding for the document? Is it consistent across documents?

Using Huffman coding on this document would result in an expected cost of nlogn for a Huffman encoding for the document because since each character has the same frequency, they will also have the same cost, balanced Huffman tree.
